---Introduction
Use the left/right arrow keys to navigate through these tutorials. Or, press the arrows on my sides!
Welcome to Faiz's Mod, a Physics Sandbox in which you are a God who controls all!
Since you are a God, you can do stuff a God would. The point(s) you see in front of you resonate with the spirits of angels, allowing you to interact with objects regardless of their size and mass. Check out the other guides to learn how to play! (Or don't. If you don't like reading, check out my video introduction!)
---ControlsnewLine(Keyboard/Mouse)
Press ' W/A/S/D ' to move around and move the mouse to look around.
Left-click to select points while God's Hand intersects with a point. Keep left-click held to drag them around, and release left-click to throw them!
Press ' ###recall ' to teleport the last selected point to God's Hand, ' ###pause ' to pause the Physics simulation, and ' ###GUISelector ' to summon the GUI selector.
All GUIs can have their values reset by pressing ' ###reset ' once. By pressing ' ###reset ' twice in quick succession, their values will be set to their global default. Manual input GUIs can be dismissed by selecting them and pressing ' enter '.
---ControlsnewLine(VR)
Tilt the ' left stick ' to move around, and tilt the ' right stick ' to move up/down.
Press the ' ###select ' to select a point while either God's Hand intersects with one. Keep the trigger held to drag them around, and release the trigger to throw them!
Press ' ###recall ' to teleport the last selected point to that God's Hand, ' ###pause ' to pause the Physics simulation, and ' ###GUISelector ' to summon the GUI selector.
All GUIs can have their values reset by pressing ' ###reset ' once. By pressing ' ###reset ' twice in quick succession, their values will be set to their global default.
---GUI Guide
Press ' ###GUISelector ' to summon the GUI selector, where you'll be able to modify the physical quantities governing your world. Reversed gravity? Maybe sideways? Super-stiff joints? Super-slow time? It's all yours to control.
Once in the GUI selector, select a GUI by pressing ' ###select ' while a God's Hand is inside one of the boxes. Selecting "Slider" will allow you to modify the selected value via an interactive slider.
This may summon another set of boxes, depending on the value selected. For example, since Gravity is directional, selecting boxes containing X, Y, and/or Z will change both its direction and size based on what was selected. If the quantity is not directional (like stiffness), then selecting these values will only affect the visual appearance of the GUI.
All GUIs can have their values reset by pressing ' ###reset ' once. By pressing ' ###reset ' twice in quick succession, their values will be set to their global default.
All GUIs have an "X" button to dismiss that GUI. Manual input GUIs on keyboard/mouse can be dismissed by selecting them and pressing ' enter '.
Tip: using your infinite strength, you can double-click ' ###select ' to change the radii and densities of individual points.
---Physics Terms
gField: how quickly everything wants to move. gasDensity: The density of the air. friction: How much points hate moving when on a surface.
springConst: How much joints like to pull points. damping: How much joints hate moving faster. strain: Maximum relative size a joint can be before breaking. (UNDER DEVELOPMENT)
